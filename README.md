# CSharpImageMerger
A static class to merge multiple images into one using C#.net.

Due to a requirement we needed to layer multiple images into one image. This needed to be faster and efficient plus we didn't want to use any third party software as that would increase maintenance. Through some fun research and testing I found a neat and effective method to get the outcome required by only using C#.NET 4.6.
